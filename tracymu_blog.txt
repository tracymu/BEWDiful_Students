BEWD Week 1
30 June 2013

I actually missed the first week of the BEWD course due to being overseas. This was disappointing to me because I would appreciate the help with understanding Git and GitHub! I am more confident in my (beginners) understanding of using the terminal (command line) and basic Ruby.

I have undertaken all the tutorials and readings that our tutor Ben has recommended - as well as some extra to be able to complete this homework. Let's see if this actually gets pushed up to GitHub...

BEWD Week 2

This class we covered collections (arrays and hashes) and loops.
